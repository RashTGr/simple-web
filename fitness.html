                        <h1>The most common types of Exercises</h1>
                        <p>
                            There is a wide variety of physical activity, each of which focuses on a different area of the body and offers a different set of advantages. A distinction can be made between different types of workouts on the basis of the benefits they promise to deliver. For example, aerobic exercise focuses on improving cardiovascular health and endurance, whereas strength training focuses on building and maintaining muscle strength and mass. Both types of exercise are important for overall health. You can improve your overall fitness level as well as achieve a well-rounded and balanced workout if you include a variety of different types of exercises in your workout routine.

                                Different exercises have different benefits because they target different muscle groups. There are four categories of physical activity and exercise:

                                    <li><strong>Endurance</strong></li>
